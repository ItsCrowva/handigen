Therefor I'm gonna be keeping a log of most changes
and my incentives behinds them

30-7-21 | [10:52am - Log Start]
I'm gonna set a couple base biomes. then work on rivers.

these base biomes will be under the minecraft namespace

Base Biomes:
- Plains
- Desert
- Taiga
- Tundra
- Badlands

Flat Base Biomes:
- Ocean

uh- lower the value, higher the temperature. that works ig

I'm gonna do multiple badlands biomes with different settings

NO ALRIGHT FUCK THIS

4-8-21 | [9:02am - Ore System ]

ok log.
Time to work on the ore system

The Main Ore Zone will be
84 to -256
so uh

we have a lot to work with here

1.17 is -64 to 64 essentially, so uh- this will be tricky

Lets um- do zones.

All Zones bleed into other zones. Major Zones are really intense spawn rates

Ore Zones --------

Copper / Coal Zone - 84 to 52
Iron Zone - 52 to 12
Gold Zone - 12 to -32
Diamond Zone -32 to -50 | Plateau into Major Diamond zone. Diamond Zone however DOES NOT PLATEAU
Emerald Zone -50 to -150
Major Diamond Zone -150 to -256

Extra --------

Major Emerald Zones - -200 to -256
Obsidian Clusters - -84 to -256 | Plateau into these zones. -256 is equal to major zone.
Obsidian Geodes - -128 to -256
Magma Clusters - -64 to -256 | Plateau into bottom.
Magma Geodes - -128 to -256
Diamond Block - -232 to -256
Amethyst Geodes - 64 to -12
Iron Geodes - 32 to -32
Coal Geodes - 64 to -32
Diamond Geodes - -128 to -256

######## 4-8-21 | [2:32pm - Ore System #2 ]
Gonna cutoff World height at -128 again

And Update the ores

Ore Zones --------

Chance | Size | Discard On Air | Name | Height
8 | 10 | 0.0 | Copper / Coal Zone - 84 to 52
7 | 08 | 0.2 | Iron Zone: - 52 to 32
