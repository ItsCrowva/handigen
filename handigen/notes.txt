Therefor I'm gonna be keeping a log of most changes
and my incentives behinds them

30-7-21 | [10:52am - Log Start]
I'm gonna set a couple base biomes. then work on rivers.

these base biomes will be under the minecraft namespace

Base Biomes:
- Plains
- Desert
- Taiga
- Tundra
- Badlands

Flat Base Biomes:
- Ocean

uh- lower the value, higher the temperature. that works ig

I'm gonna do multiple badlands biomes with different settings

NO ALRIGHT FUCK THIS
